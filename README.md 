# 📨 RabbitMQ Driver Verification - CMPE 273 Assignment

## 📌 Objective

Develop a message queue system using RabbitMQ to **send and receive 10,000 messages** between a Producer and Consumer, ensuring **no message loss** in transit.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed  
- Install `pika` Python library:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install pika
Docker installed and running
VS Code with the correct Python interpreter selected
🐇 Set Up RabbitMQ (via Docker)

Start RabbitMQ server locally:

docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit \
  -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
🔗 Access the RabbitMQ Management UI: http://localhost:15672

🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Start the Consumer (in one terminal):
cd consumer
python3 cmpe273receive.py
2️⃣ Start the Producer (in another terminal):
cd producer
python3 cmpe273send.py
✅ Expected Output
